# Bankist Website

This project is a marketing website for a fictional bank called "Bankist" with dynamic effects.

## Project Description

In this project, I added a sticky navigation bar on the top and smooth scrolling effect by clicking navigation buttons. I also implemented popup, tabbed and slider components for various views. To improve page loading performance, I added lazy loading image effect.

### What I've learned
